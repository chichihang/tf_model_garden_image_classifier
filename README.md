# tf_model_garden_image_classifier

## There are some file I changed so far:

## In the venv folder:
1. configs.py (line 95 to line 106)


2. resnet_config.py


3. dataset_factory.py (line 60 to line 131)
    
    
## In the official folder:

1. dataset_factory.py (line 140 to line 150)


2. imagenet_preprocessing.py (line 45 to line 50)


3. resnet_config.py (line 28 to line 55)


4. gpu.yaml

### However, some editions are useless that means some of them do not affect the classifier_trainer.py.


## Last, For the $MODEL.DIR folder, it will auto-generate after running the classifier_trainer.py.
